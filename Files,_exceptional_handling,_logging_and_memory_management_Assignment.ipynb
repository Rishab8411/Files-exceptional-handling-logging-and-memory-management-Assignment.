        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "    - Interpreted languages execute code line by line, making debugging easier but slower in execution (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution, making them faster but requiring a compilation step (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage runtime errors using try, except, finally, and else blocks. It prevents programs from crashing when errors like division by zero or file not found occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's mainly used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "    - Logging is used to track events in a program. Instead of printing messages, we use the logging module to store logs at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). This helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",

        "    - import module_name imports the entire module, and we access functions using module_name.function().\n",

        "    - Stores logs for future analysis.\n",

        "    - Supports different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",

        "    - Memory management in Python is handled automatically using techniques like reference counting, garbage collection, and dynamic memory allocation. The gc module helps manage unused objects and free up memory.\n",

        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Use try to write the risky code.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Use except to handle specific errors.\n",

        "    - Optionally, use else to execute code if no exception occurs.\n",

        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "    - Proper memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures efficient use of system resources. It helps programs run smoothly without consuming unnecessary memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, while the except block catches and handles the error to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    - Python uses reference counting (deletes objects when references drop to zero) and garbage collection (removes circular references) to free memory automatically. The gc module can be used to control garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is useful for keeping normal execution separate from error handling.\n",

        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "    - Closing a file ensures that all data is properly saved, prevents memory leaks, and releases system resources. The with statement automatically handles this.\n",

        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
